# Saturday evening
Joint pre-wedding celebration: for those of you in town already, we’ll be celebrating informally at [De Kleine Duivel](https://www.google.com/maps/place/De+Kleine+Duivel/@39.3313023,-76.6340069,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x77eb592bddbfe416!8m2!3d39.3313023!4d-76.6340069) at 3602 Hickory Ave, starting from 7pm. We'll be there for much of the evening, so please do come by anytime after 7pm and stay for however long you’d like! We’ll have delicious Greek treats (sweet and savory) from a nearby spot we love and yummy drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) as well. Let us know by October 13th if you’ll be stopping by so we know how many snacks to get!

# After the reception
Post-wedding celebration: If you’re not catching the late night Sunday car/bus/train/plane to get back for work on Monday, we’d love for you to drop by our place after the wedding to continue the festivities! We’ll have board games, drinks, perhaps some late night pizza, and extra cake for all. Casual as can be, but it’ll give us some extra time to spend with the people we love.
